# Knowmer
These tools help analyze RNA sequence data to find repeat K-mers that regulate important genes and proteins. 
The Knowmers Repository is a research project that has free open-source tools and methods to perform k-mer analysis for computational genomics research or scientific curiousity. 
The README file is intended for people interested in working with Python source code in either Google Colab (preferred), Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda Navigator, and Deepnote. 
Some of the tools used in the Knowmers Repository include Bio, Biopython, Bioconda, seaborn, matplotlib, and pandas to name a few. These tools come from the Biopython Package. The Biopython package is open source software made available under generous terms. Please see the LICENSE (Link to BioPython License: https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/LICENSE.rst) file for further details. 
Since we are heavily using Biopython in this repository, if you use the Knowmers Repository, you will probably be using BioPython. If you use Biopython in any work contributing to a scientific publication, we ask that you cite the application note (below) or one of the module specific publications (listed on our website):

# Software Requirements
We recommend to use Google Colab or the most updated version of Jupyter Notebooks (Helpful Guide: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-guide/install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/)  & Anaconda Navigator (Helfpul Guide: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/anaconda-navigator/install). 

# Jupyter Notebook Software Requirements for Windows Users
1. Python 3.7 or later
2. Windows 7 or later
